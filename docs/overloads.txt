OVERLOADS

NEW SYNTACTIC FEATURES:

- None

NEW SEMANTIC FEATURES:

- Functions can have the same name, so long as the return types are the same
- Functions will now be stored with a unique id, and a lookup table will point names to lists of ids
- Anytime a function is used, its name is used to look up the list of overloads, and the arguments are used to determine the correct id, if applicable
- The most specific argument types are attempted first, in argument order
- If no assignable function with the right number of arguments is found, it's an error
- Function references are stored by id for the next step
- Exported functions will store the list of exported ids
- Imported functions will import that list

TRANSFORMATION:

- The typechecking step stores the correct function id in the module for lookup
- Nothing else in the process needs to change
